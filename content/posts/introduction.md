# Introduction

Welcome to my blog, this blog will mostly be about my adventures and trials in my job as an IT professional. It will contain snippets of code to solve the problems I come across on a day to day basis.

# About Me

I'm a 25-year veteran of the IT world, I've done pretty much any job in IT. I've been a trainer, I've done hardware support and software support. I've done most IT Professional tasks, from creating specifications for IT equipment, negotiated prices, arranged ordering, through to setting up and provisioning the hardware and installing and configuring the required software.

# What am I going to talk about

At the moment I'm employed as a Support Engineer and I work mainly on automation tasks, so I am going to talk about Azure Dev Ops, pipeline, repos etc, GitHub but mostly about my current technology love - PowerShell.
